## Make it yours
- All the defaults are in **config.js** at the top.
- The layers listing, grouping and colors are decided by a **map_layers.csv** in config/ folder.
- Shapefiles are in data/ folder. Their exact filenames should be put in map_layers.csv .

## Deploy locally
- Easiest way if you have python3 working: Open command line at the folder and `python3 -m http.server` then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
- If there's an apache or nginx server installed, drop the folder in their www / htdocs path or so.
- For windows, search for "portable web server" - there's a lot of solutions.
